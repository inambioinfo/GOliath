This folder contains the processed GO data for the different species this instance of GOliath supports.  These will be the outputs of the processing scripts in the processing folder.

Each species will be a folder in this directory.  Under that will be one or more subfolders representing different releases (normally Ensembl release numbers).  Inside these subfolders will be the files that the processing script creates.
